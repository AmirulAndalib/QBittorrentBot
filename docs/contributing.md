## Adding translations
If you are multilingual and would like to help us make QBittorrentBot more accessible to a wider audience, you can contribute by adding new translations or improving existing ones using Transifex:

- Visit the [QBittorrentBot Transifex Project](https://app.transifex.com/ch3p4ll3/qbittorrentbot/).

- If you don't have a Transifex account, sign up for one. If you already have an account, log in.

- Navigate to the "Languages" tab to view the available languages. Choose the language you want to contribute to.

- Locate the specific string you wish to translate. Please note that the text between "${" and "}" should not be edited, as they are placeholders for dynamic content.

- Click on the string you want to translate, enter your translation in the provided field, and save your changes.

- If your language is not listed, you can request its addition.

- Once you have completed your translations, submit them for review. The project maintainers will review and approve your contributions.

Thank you for helping improve QBittorrentBot with your valuable translations!
